# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I have made two USB ports to plug in. I am making these just to explore how PCB's are made and how exactly do they work.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
This project is going to cost $29.09
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally Optional*** -->
I basically followed a tutorial from Hack club to make my design. I just want to learn how is this done. The challenges were that it was a little tough to keep up with the tutorial as it was too fast. Pausing and slowing down the video helped.
